This repository contains my Excel Portfolio Project which is a detailed analysis of more than 44,000 government schools in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Various important insights were calculated and visualized on a PowerBi dashboard.

# Excel Portfolio Project: Educational Landscape Analysis in Punjab, Pakistan

# Overview

This project involved analyzing a dataset containing detailed information about schools in Punjab, Pakistan. The goal was to derive actionable insights to allocate a budget of 833 million PKR for improving educational infrastructure, facilities, and access. Using tools like Microsoft Excel and Power BI, we identified critical gaps in resources and formulated a data-driven strategy to address them.

# Objectives

1. Analyze data to identify districts with critical infrastructure and facility deficiencies.

2. Allocate budgets to improve school facilities, encourage enrollment, and reduce gender disparities.

3. Develop actionable insights for sustainable improvements over multiple project phases.

# Tools and Methodology

Tools Used:

1. Microsoft Excel for data analysis, conditional formatting, and labeling.

2. Power BI for dynamic visualizations and dashboard creation.

3. Microsoft Word for documentation and reporting.

# Data Preparation and Analysis

1. Conditional Labeling:
IF statements were used extensively to create additional columns for specific labels based on conditions (e.g., schools lacking electricity were tagged as "Electricity Needed").

2. Filtering and Sorting:
Filters and sorts were applied to isolate critical subsets, such as schools with missing facilities.
Sorted districts by resource availability to identify the lowest-performing regions.

3. Error Handling:
Errors like #NAME in the dataset were replaced using Power BI's Power Query Editor.

4. Data Cleaning:
Ensured unique identifier columns were error-free.
Addressed missing values in non-critical fields without impacting analysis.

5. Dynamic Visualizations:
Created Power BI dashboards with interactive slicers for district, tehsil, and resource availability, enabling better decision-making.

# Key Insights

1. Critical Deficiencies:

Schools in specific districts lacked basic amenities like toilets, electricity, and drinking water.
Many schools required security, functional classrooms, and boundary walls.

2. Gender Disparities:

The need for separate schools for boys and girls was evident, especially in rural areas, to encourage female education.

3. Resource Allocation:

Boundary walls, building conditions, and functional classrooms received the highest budget due to high costs and importance.
Water and electricity issues were less expensive to address and allocated lower budgets.

4. Budget Highlights and Allotment

Infrastructure and Facilities were allotted a total of 41 million PKR. It was divided as follows

Boundary Walls: 7.5M

Functional Classrooms: 7.5M

Building Condition: 7.5M

Toilets and Security: 2.5M combined

Playgrounds and Labs: 15M

Upgrades and New Schools were allotted a total of 200 million PKR. It was divided as follows

Separate Schools: 100M

Upgrades: 50M

New Primary Schools: 50M

Total Allocation for Phase 1: 241 million PKR

The remaining funds allow for multiple phases, ensuring sustainable improvements across the province.

# Marketing and Outreach

1. Localized Social Media Campaigns:
Showcase improvements and success stories.

2. Community Information Events:
Educate families on new resources and encourage attendance.

3. Collaborative Partnerships:
Work with NGOs and local leaders to extend impact.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in addressing educational disparities. Using advanced Excel techniques, such as conditional labeling and filters, combined with Power BI visualizations, we prioritized urgent needs and planned for scalable improvements. This ensures a significant and lasting impact on Punjab's educational landscape.
